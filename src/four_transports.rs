#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The four avenues this web server can use to reach `zed-api-server`.
//!
//! Generated from the fleet-wide contract in
//! <https://github.com/ORESoftware/ores-transport>, which owns the parts that
//! are shared *and* subtle: the envelope, the byte ceilings, absolute
//! deadlines, reply correlation, global backpressure, and the
//! redeliver-versus-terminate decision. This module owns only what is specific
//! to zed-pkg — the environment prefix, the service slug that names its NATS
//! subjects, and the api route that accepts an envelope.
//!
//! | # | Mode | What happens |
//! |---|------|--------------|
//! | 1 | `direct_read` | this server queries Postgres itself through `zed-lib-core`, read-only |
//! | 2 | `http` | stateless request to the `zed-api-server` cluster |
//! | 3 | `tcp` | framed, held-open connection to the `zed-api-server` cluster |
//! | 4 | `jet_stream` | published to NATS; the api server answers asynchronously |
//!
//! # Finishing the wiring
//!
//! One thing is left to this repository, because only this repository knows
//! what an operation *is*: implement [`ores_transport::DirectReader`] over
//! `zed-lib-core`'s read context, and hand it to [`gateway_from_env`]. See
//! `docs/four-transports.md`.
